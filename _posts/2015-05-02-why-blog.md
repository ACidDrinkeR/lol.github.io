Why do I need to blog? It doesn't make sense, I'm just a regular college going student with nothing worthwile to share (yet).

There are a ton of logical reasons as to why one should be writing about things; but to be honest, it doesn't matter why I blog as long as I like doing it. <!--more-->The same holds for almost everything I do. I just enjoy doing a particular set of things and I do them. There's no point in justifying everything in life, it must be the other way around i.e life must be justified by the things you do.

I've always thought that writing down stuff I think/believe in would be fun and helpful at the same time. I could analyse my thoughts at a later stage and get a quick overview of how I've spent my time. It would help me in organizing my thoughts and bringing them to life in a neat summary. When writing down your thoughts, you indirectly practise mindfulnes. It helps to look your life from a different perspective because you are forced to look and think about different things around you, your surroundings, and your life in a way which you otherwise wouldn't have. 

What I believe is that 'Blogging' is a journey, and writing is it's path. I like the idea of writing and hence I've taken up this journey to enjoy what I love doing.

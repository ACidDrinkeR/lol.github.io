# Welcome to [my](/author) blog.  

#### It's a personal blog revolving around my life, computers and the multi-verse.

I will be posting both 'personal' and 'technical' content here.
My main motivation is to get my thoughts out in the open and share them with everyone and learning cool stuff along the way.  

This site was coded using HTML, CSS, Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap. I have not used any template and hard coded from scratch. 
If you wish to use mysite design, you are free to do so (It's licensed under MIT_License), you can fork the whole code from
my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/miteshms).  

This site/blog was launched on **2nd April**, 2015.

This site has a very minimal layout and simple color scheme: [ 'Black', 'Gray', 'White', 'Mild aqua Blue', 'Aqua Green' ] and
I intend to keep it that way.

I've seen a lot of other bloggers / sites having 'TAGS'.   

*But do we really ever use tags to browse sites extensively?*  
*Atleast, I don't.* 

Hence I want to keep the site minimal and less of distractions. i.e to the point.

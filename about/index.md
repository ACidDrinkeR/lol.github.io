# Welcome to [my](/author) blog.  

#### It's a personal/technical blog revolving around my life, computers and the multi-verse.

My main motivation is to get my thoughts out in the open and learn cool stuff along the way.  

This site has a very minimal layout and simple color scheme: [ 'Black', 'Gray', 'White', 'Aqua Green' ] and I intend to keep it that way.

Now you may ask why I do not hav 'tags' or 'social sharing buttons'?  
Well, I simply beleive that if somebody wants to share something they will share it with or without the buttons. But for people who just want to read the content, adding share buttons is a distraction. 
I personally hate it when websites have tons of unnecessary distraction hindering and hanging around the content in the form of tags, buttons, sidebars, multicolored text etc and hence I made something which I personally liked/would love to read.

Hence I want to keep the site **minimal**, **clean** and **void of distractions**. i.e to the point. 

This site was coded using HTML, CSS, Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap. I have hard coded most of the code from scratch. 
If you wish to use my-site design, you are free to do so (It's licensed under MIT_License), you can fork the whole code from
my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/miteshms).  

This site/blog was launched on **2nd April**, 2015.
